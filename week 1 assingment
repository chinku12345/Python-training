# The current volume of water reservoir(in cubic metres)

# The amount of water of rainfall from a storm in cubic meters)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall = (rainfall * 0.9)
# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume = rainfall + reservoir_volume

# increase the reservoir_volume by 5% to account the storm water that flows
reservoir_volume = reservoir_volume * 1.05

# decrease the reservoir_volume by 5% to account for storm water that flows
reservoir_volume = reservoir_volume * 0.95

# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from the reservoir_volume to account for water
# that is piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume = reservoir_volume - 2.5e5
